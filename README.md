# Computationally Efficient Integrated Navigation Using FAST-INS and STEKF

**FAST-INS** is a high-performance inertial navigation system (INS) designed to significantly enhance the computational efficiency of traditional navigation algorithms by leveraging precise preintegration techniques. The method focuses on reducing computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications on resource-constrained embedded systems.

## Key Features:
- **Fast Preintegration**: Optimized to reduce computational load, enabling efficient processing of inertial data.
- **Precise Estimation**: Maintains high accuracy for position, velocity, and attitude estimation.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Designed for use in embedded systems with limited resources, ideal for maritime, terrestrial, and aerial applications.
